\n\
You are locked in the hotel, just like servants of the pharaohs\n\
were locked in the Pyramids with their masters.\n\
You will need to hack yourself a way out of the hotel before\n\
the end of the weekend (when the hotel will be closed up\n\
forever, WHOAHAHAHAHAHAHA)!\n\

when you see "The [R]eception" in the game, you can use "e r" to enter\n\
the Reception.\n\
